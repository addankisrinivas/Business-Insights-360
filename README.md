## 🏢 Project Overview

**Business Scenario:**  
AtliQ Hardware, a global electronics manufacturer, struggled with slow, manual Excel-based reporting, making real-time decision-making difficult. Business Insights 360 replaces those legacy processes with an interactive Power BI dashboard, providing actionable insights across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive functions.

**Goal:**  
Deliver a modern, fully interactive dashboard for faster, more effective business decisions.
